mpv scripts for retards

## [autotag.lua](/autotag)
Allows MPV to update the tags of media watched once played beyond a certain percentage in MPV (ie: to tag as "Watched" once the credits roll).

This allows you to keep track of which episode you're up to in your file manager natively while "Group by Tags" is enabled, the horizintal "bookmark" moving further up as you watch, eliminating the need for a seperate spreadsheet or bloat online tracking sites such as MAL.

The name of the tag applied, requisite watch percentagte, and whitelisted directories are user configurable. Supports symlinked files. Optionally deletes symlinks in seperately whitelisted rectories.

Only supports Linux. (Does Windows even support tags anymore?)
